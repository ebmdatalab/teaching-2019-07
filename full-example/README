This program:

* scrapes any new records from https://www.england.nhs.uk/news/
* appends new records to a CSV file
* updates a notebook with some analysis
* if configured, sends an email notification about new articles

Sending email
-------------

To send email from PythonAnywhere, you will need a gmail.com account.

I strongly suggest that you don't reuse an existing account, but instead create
a new one for the purpose, as you will need to give your code running on
PythonAnywhere access to your inbox via a password.  (And if you have shared
your PythonAnywhere account with a teacher, they could gain access to the
inbox.)

Once you've created a new account, you'll want to create an app password:

* Go to https://myaccount.google.com/
* Ensure you are managing the new account
* Click on "Security" on LHS
* Enable 2-Step Verification
* Go back to the Security page
* Click on "App passwords"
* Generate a new password
  * Choose an app type of "Other"
  * Enter "pythonanywhere-nhs-news-scraper" for a name
  * Copy this password

You should now update config.py:

* Change SEND_EMAIL to True
* Change EMAIL_RECIPIENT to your email address
* Change EMAIL_USER to the address of the account you have just created
* Change EMAIL_PASSWORD to the app password you have just created for this
  account


Running the scraper hourly
--------------------------

You can schedule PythonAnywhere to run a task hourly or daily.

On the Tasks tab, create a new hourly task that runs

    python3 /home/[your username]/full-example/scraper.py

You can view any output of running the scheduled task by clicking the "View
task log" button on the Tasks tab.
